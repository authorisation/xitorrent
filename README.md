### Why in the flying fuck did I create this?
BECAUSE IT'S COOL

### Okay, but why is there yumeko?

### Why is it called [X info torrent]
I don't know, sounded cool to me, I guess?

### This is cool, how can I contribute?
Just open a PR, if it looks good and I like it I will merge it. Can be really anything. The only condition is that you write it under the GPLv3 license.

### OMG, your code sucks!
Shhhh... PR please.. >.<

## Compiling
Ok so compiling this shit is pretty easy, all you do it really just:
1. `$ git clone https://github.com/authorisation/xitorrent`
2. `$ cd xitorrent & make`<br>
Optionally if you want to install it system-wide run:
3. `$ sudo make install`<br>
If you use doas run it with doas, you should know this.
